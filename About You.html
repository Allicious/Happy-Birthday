    You are hands down the best thing that happened to me this year. The first person I've ever truly loved. 
    Every second I spent with you as mine was heaven to me. I still have dreams of your smile, but rn they are 
    more like nightmares. You deserve the world and even though I may not be the one to give it you, I hope someone will. 
    I hope the universe finally sees you how I see you, beautiful inside and out and deserving of happiness and love,
    and everything good.
    I've said this several times before but you're the only person who never made me feel the urge to be perfomative to
    gain your attention and affection, and that is something I will forever carry with me. 
    I'm still not any good at writing letters so I'll wrap this up;
    HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I hope you had an amzing time celebrating it, and I hope the universe is kind to you in this new 
    chapter of yuor life.
    I love you. Always have always will. And I'm always going to be here for you whenever you need me.
    Happy Birthday beautiful. ❤️🐾
    -S
